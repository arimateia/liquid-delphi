# liquid-delphi
Delphi Port of Tobias LÃ¼tke's Liquid template language.

### What is this?

Liquid-delphi is a Delphi port of the popular [Ruby Liquid templating
language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and [dotLiquid](https://github.com/dotliquid/dotliquid) implementation. It is a separate project that aims to
retain the same template syntax as the original, while using delphi coding
conventions where possible.
